        text: 'Soils are the basis of life, and soil health is the foundation of sustainable and regenerative food systems. Healthy soils are critical for increasing food and nutrition security, improving livelihoods, meeting climate change mitigation and adaptation goals, enhancing above and below-ground biodiversity, restoring ecosystems and providing many more benefits to us all. However, they face an unprecedented crisis: top soil is being lost at an annual rate of approximately 36 billion tons, and global cropland erosion has reached 17 billion tons. This results in $300 billion in lost agricultural production annually.'

        text: ', at this year’s COP28, the coalition members will convey an even stronger sense of urgency of action. Along with showcasing the concrete actions taken by governments, growers, financial institutions, the private sector and more to accelerate and scale the adoption of sustainable soil management practices, the coalition will seek to catalyze dialogue, innovation and motivation toward scaling healthy soil practices the world over. They will explore how to enable soil as strategic tool to deliver on the Paris Agreement; the benefits soils bring for nature, people and climate; the collaborative partnerships required to innovate our approach to soil health; what regenerative agriculture proposes for holistic and long-term climate action and what growers need for long-term climate resilience.'
