        text: 'The protracted global conflicts and crises, caused first by the pandemic and then by the war in Ukraine, led to major disruption in global food supply chains. This was further aggravated by climate impacts, especially those observed throughout 2023. Policymakers and companies provided effective rapid-response solutions, attempting to correct market disruptions and offering relief in some of the hardest-hit countries.'

These estimates, from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) respectively, highlight the impact that the war in Ukraine is having on a food system already stressed by climate change impacts, covid-related supply chain disruptions, and increasing evidence of damage caused by accelerating biodiversity loss.'

        text: 'Today, food security remains top of mind globally, and the current conflict in the Middle East will likely cause this to intensify. Inflation, coupled with a continuous focus on short-term actions risks impeding sustainability and longer-term ‘greener’ solutions in the food, energy, and climate sectors. High food inflation and the prospect of rising food insecurity are often sufficient to roll back sustainability policies, including in Europe, where governments have been most ambitious on biodiversity preservation.'

And while carbon remains an important component—both in terms of emissions reductions and financing opportunities—other factors such as biodiversity, soil health, and water are claiming equal ground.'

A third of the planet’s soils are now moderately to highly degraded, and the FAO projects that business as usual through 2050 could lead to additional soil degradation of an area roughly the size of South America. Regenerative agriculture is recognized as one approach to restore and maintain soil health, reverse biodiversity loss and provide both environmental security and food security.'

Three key elements in this process are:'

These disclosures will help improve the overall understanding of the comparative financial risks of ‘business as usual’ versus the alternatives.'

We will be continuing these conversations to facilitate a pathway forward that protects the long-term health of the global population and the planet itself.'
