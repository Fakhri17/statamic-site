        text: 'Phosphate rock is used as the main raw material to produce phosphate fertilizers, an important source of phosphorus for productive and healthy crops. It is also used to manufacture feed additives and some industrial products, including the fast rising market of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for electric vehicles. The most popular phosphate fertilizers derived from phosphate rock include ammonium phosphates, superphosphates and NPK fertilizers. In 2020, world phosphate fertilizer consumption was estimated at about 49 million tonnes (Mt) P'
